Implementing classical and modern reinforcement learning algorithms for simple use cases.

We will explore different algorithms from classical and modern reinforcement learning, starting with the simple Q-learning method. Next will be a DQN implementation for the simple use case of Tic-Tac-Toe.

I achieved: Human level intelligence on Tic-Tac-Toe by duelling a soft player against a precision player. See my github account.

I managed to implement an extension of the paper "Deep Q-Trading" (extended by convolutional neural networks implemented in TensorFlow).
