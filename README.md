# reinforcement_learning_explorations
Implementing classic and modern reinforcement learning algorithms for simple use cases.

We will explore different algorithms from classic and modern reinforcement learning, starting with the simple Q-learning method. Next will be a DQN implementation for the simple use case of Tic-Tac-Toe.
